#### AndroidShellHolder

```
This is the Android owner of the core engine Shell.

This is the top orchestrator class on the C++ side for the Android embedding. It corresponds to a FlutterEngine on the Java side. This class is in C++ because the Shell is in C++ and an Android orchestrator needs to exist to compose it with other Android specific C++ components such as the PlatformViewAndroid. This composition of many-to-one C++ components would be difficult to do through JNI whereas a FlutterEngine and AndroidShellHolder has a 1:1 relationship.

Technically, the FlutterJNI class owns this AndroidShellHolder class instance, but the FlutterJNI class is meant to be mostly static and has minimal state to perform the C++ pointer <-> Java class instance translation.
